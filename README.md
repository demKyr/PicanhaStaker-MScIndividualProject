## Description
TruStake Picanha vault is a staking vault for MATIC tokens, meticulously designed to optimize transaction fees for both staking and unstaking processes. Our objective is to make native staking accessible to all, offering a passive and secure source of income, guided by:
- Trustless operation
- Non-custodial management
- Risk-free participation
